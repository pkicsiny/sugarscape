## Sugarscape
Sugarscape [1] is an agent-based simulation by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert L. Axtell modeling an artificial society where agents move on a 2D grid and collect "sugar" from grid cells to accumulate "wealth". At the same time agents can reproduce, consume sugar and can die if they run out of it. In more advanced implementations agents can also trade and pollute their environment. This project is a simplified custom implementation in Python using PyQt. Depending on the input parameters, the simulation can exhibit population outbreaks, oscillations or convergence.
